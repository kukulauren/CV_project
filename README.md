# CV_project
This is my first cv project I tested in Introduction to AI class.
This have only 5 images (data) for each set of animals.
Here, I set L2 regulariation with 0.01 to prevent overfit but the adam values are default as follows.
- learning_rate=0.001
- beta_1=0.9
- beta_2=0.999
- epsilon=1e-07
  
The score are as follows.
- Accuracy Score 60.0 %
- Precision Macro Score  74.81481481481481 %
- Recall_Score 60.0 %
- F1_Score 56.82539682539684 %
